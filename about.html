			<h2>Our Story</h2>
			<p>The Open Shop Channel was started in March 2018 by dhtdht020, who wanted to make a service to download homebrew apps with your Wii again.</p>
		<p>The original plan for the project was to make a Wii Shop Channel replacement, which was a lot of work that we didn't enjoy and not fun to work on.</p>
		<p>An additional service was planned called Club Spot, which gave you perks for using the Open Shop Channel.</p>
		<p>What we originally envisioned the Open Shop Channel to be was ambitious. It wasn't gonna work out.</p>
		<p>We eventually changed our plans to revive the Homebrew Browser, an app to download homebrew.</p></div>
